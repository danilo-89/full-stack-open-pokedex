1. In the ecosystem of Python, following could be used:

- [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) for linting, which checks for coding standards and errors.
- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing, which is a powerful framework for writing test cases.
- [Tox](https://tox.wiki/) for virtual environments, allowing for testing against multiple Python versions.
- [Setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for building and packaging Python applications.

2. For CI/CD, besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, alternatives like [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) are popular choices. They offer user-friendly interfaces, integration with version control systems, and the ability to trigger builds on code commits.

3. Choosing between a self-hosted and a cloud-based CI environment depends on various factors:

- Self-hosted environments provide full control and customization but require more maintenance and potentially higher costs for hardware and maintenance.
- Cloud-based environments, such as those offered by Azure DevOps, AWS, or Google Cloud CI, offer scalability, ease of use, and reduced maintenance burden. However, they might come with limitations on customization and potential vendor lock-in concerns
- To decide, consider the team's technical expertise, budget, required features, scalability needs, and future growth plans. The decision also hinges on whether the team prefers managing servers or focusing on development, and if there are any specific compliance or security requirements to consider ([1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-ci-cd-tools/), [2](https://www.simplilearn.com/best-ci-cd-tools-article), [3](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/top-ci-cd-tools), [4](https://testsigma.com/blog/ci-cd-tools/)).
